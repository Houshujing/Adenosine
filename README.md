DNN and CNN classification models of dual A1/A2A ARs antagonists
=============
##Requirements

This software has been tested on Linux with GTX 1080Ti GPUs. We think it should work with other linux-based setups quite easily.
 
Prerequisites include:
* Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib: These are all found in [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* [RDkit] (http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)
* [Theano] (http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html)
* [Lasagne] (http://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html)

## General Usage

Generate extended connectivity fingerprint 4 (dnn_fingerprints.py)
Generate neural fingerprint (cnn_fingerprints.py)
Train and test DNN model (DNN.py)
Train and test CNN model (CNN.py)
